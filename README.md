# SKYLAH-frontend

This is a frontend theme I created by editng a free Bootstrap theme called "Grayscale" according to my needs. Skylah is a chatbot service and this is ought to be its initial design. 

As I used an open-source theme I also declare this as open-source. You can use this according to your will and help improve it even further.
